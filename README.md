 ## Project Overview.
 
 ## Business Problem.
 
 ## Data Anaysis and Understanding.
 
 ## Final Results.
 
 ## Conclusion.
- This illustrates the relationship between the production budget and the return on investment. it shows production budget and return on investment has a weak positive correlation meaning when production budget increase, the profit increases as well. Microsoft cannot achieved profitability based on this result because it is weak and unreliable.

- The barplot above between 2010 to 2019 we can see a positive value change of 60% in the worldwide gross bring about more positve increase in total gross as well. I can encourage Microsoft to not only publish movies only domestically but look into producing movies that will be viewed across world.

- From the barplot above we see return on investment were made signicantly increase only when the movies were published internationaly. 2010 recorded the highest profit, Highest production budget with the Highest number of votes even those the Ratings from 2010-2019 did not impact the profitablity. Microsoft can't determine profitability on rating only domestically and internationally.

- In the exploratory section, from my findings 'Avengers: Infinity War' has the highest return on investment was 2.4 Billion with "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi" genre, in the findings above we can "Sci-Fi" genres a likely to bring to profitable, Microsoft inc.can look into such genres in that catergories
