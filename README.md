  ### Name:Olaide Kashimawo
 
 ## Project Overview.
 
 I will be sifting through movie dataset in order to discover various relationships between variables such as production budget, domestic gross , worldwide gross, total gross and profitability to generate insight for Microsoft stakeholders on starting a movie studio.

 
 ## Business Problem.
 
 Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and determine profitability.


 ## Data Anaysis and Understanding.
 In this step, I gathered data, a csv spreadsheet, then load it into a dataframe to assess its quality. I will be looking for missing value and problems in quality and/or structure. We will be removing extraneous data and making modifications, such as replacing information and removing duplicates, to ensure our dataset is trim and clean for analysis
 
 ## Final Results.

 ## Conclusion.
- This illustrates the relationship between the production budget and the return on investment. it shows production budget and return on investment has a weak positive correlation meaning when production budget increase, the profit increases as well. Microsoft cannot achieved profitability based on this result because it is weak and unreliable.

- The barplot above between 2010 to 2019 we can see a positive value change of 60% in the worldwide gross bring about more positve increase in total gross as well. I can encourage Microsoft to not only publish movies only domestically but look into producing movies that will be viewed across world.

- From the barplot above we see return on investment were made signicantly increase only when the movies were published internationaly. 2010 recorded the highest profit, Highest production budget with the Highest number of votes even those the Ratings from 2010-2019 did not impact the profitablity. Microsoft can't determine profitability on rating only domestically and internationally.

- In the exploratory section, from my findings 'Avengers: Infinity War' has the highest return on investment was 2.4 Billion with "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi" genre, in the findings above we can "Sci-Fi" genres a likely to bring to profitable, Microsoft inc.can look into such genres in that catergories
